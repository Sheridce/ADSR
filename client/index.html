    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <p>
      The volunteer angler diary program is a tool used to
      evaluate specific fish populations and management
      actions. Diary data can be used to estimate and monitor
      catch rates, harvest rates, the contribution of stocked and
      wild fish in some cases, or performance of different
      species or strains. It can also reveal changes in the length-
      frequency distributions of monitored species and fish
      community structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important that the information you provide in the
        diaries is accurate. Please record every fishing trip,
        even if no fish were caught. Fill out all information for
        each trip.
    </p>
    <h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
    <p> <b>Number of Anglers:</b>  if fishing alone, enter "1". If
      fishing with another angler cooperator who is keeping
      his or or her own diary, each of you should enter "1".
      Otherwise enter the number of anglers in the boat or
      party who are being included in a trip report.</p>
    <p> <b>Trip Date:</b> Select date of the fishing trip.</p>
    <p> <b>Area Fished: </b> Select North Basin, Narrows, or South Basin.</p>
    <p> <b>Type of Fishing: </b> Check the box for the type of fishing
      that applies to this trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Total Time Spent Fishing: </b> Record the total
      time, to the nearest quarter-hour, that you spent
      fishing. Exclude time taken for breaks in your fishing
      day. For instance, if you fished 2.25 hours before
      lunch, then an additional 1 hour after supper, write
      3.25 in the space.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Target Species: </b>Check the box to the left of the species
      you are targeting: Lake trout, Bass (Largemouth or
      Smallmouth bass), Northern pike, Yellow perch, White
      perch, Sunfish (Pumpkinseed or Bluegill), or Bullhead.
      To the right of the target species checked, record the
      amount of time spent focusing on that species. For
      instance, you may have cast for bass for 2.25 hours,
      then switched tactics and trolled for pike for an hour.
      Write 2.25 in the space to the right of Bass, and 1 to
      the right of Northern Pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>No Fish Caught Today: </b>If you did not catch any fish
      (kept or released), check this box. However, do record
      all other data requested before this line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Species: </b>Use the dropdown to select the species you
      caught
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Total Length: </b>Measure all fish from tip of snout to tip
      of tail, to nearest Â¼ inch. Tail should be pinched
      straight to achieve maximum length. Fish released
      should be measured quickly and returned to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Kept or Released: </b>Check the appropriate box in the
      columns to the right of 'Total Length' to indicate
      whether you kept or released the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Personal Notes: </b>Use this space to record information
      about this trip for your own use, or to clarify any of the
      items mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please examine any lake trout caught closely to check
      for deformed or missing fins which may have been
      removed for special studies conducted by the New
      York State Department of Environmental Conservation
      (NYSDEC). More than one fin may have been removed,
      so check both sides and back of each fish. The diagram
      below shows the names of the fins and where tags
      may be located.
